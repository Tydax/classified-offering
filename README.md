This application offers a way to organise Secret Santas with its friends.

What is **Secret Santa**, you might ask? Eeach person in a group is assigned another person, becoming that person's *secret santa*. Then, the secret santa has to find a gift for that person before the final day. On the final day, each secret santa offers their gift to their assigned person, revealing all the secret santas for a final surprise.
